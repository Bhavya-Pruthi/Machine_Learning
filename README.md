Machine Learning Handwritten Models
 
Few of the most famous machine learning models have been created from scratch in this repository.The purpose of writing handwritten algorithms is to achieve high level understanding of these complicated models.These algorithms helps in understanding the mathematics and working of these models.

1.Logistics Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression). Mathematically, a binary logistic model has a dependent variable with two possible values, such as pass/fail which is represented by an indicator variable, where the two values are labeled "0" and "1".

2.K_means Algrorithm 

K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K.

3.Support Vector Machine ( SVM )

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples. In two dimentional space this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where in each class lay in either side.

4.K Nearest Neighbour 

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.It relies on labeled input data to learn a function that produces an appropriate output when given new unlabeled data.

5.Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is useful for finding relationship between two continuous variables. One is predictor or independent variable and other is response or dependent variable.The core idea is to obtain a line that best fits the data. The best fit line is the one for which total prediction error (all data points) are as small as possible. Error is the distance between the point to the regression line.

6.Multi-Variable Linear Regression

The multiple linear regression explains the relationship between one continuous dependent variable (y) and two or more independent variables.
